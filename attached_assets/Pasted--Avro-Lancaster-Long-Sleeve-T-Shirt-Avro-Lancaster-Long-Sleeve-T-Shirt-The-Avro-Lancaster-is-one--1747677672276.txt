Avro Lancaster Long Sleeve T-Shirt
The Avro Lancaster is one of the most iconic aircraft deployed in the Second World War. Its unmistakable shape and the roar of its four Rolls Royce Merlin engines can only be experienced by seeing the two remaining airworthy examples in the world fly. One is in England and another is based at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario. We are lucky to see the Canadian Lanc fly regularly around Toronto and were inspired to celebrate this incredible piece of Aviation History with our long sleeve cotton crew neck shirt. It features the tail colours of CGVRA on the left upper arm and comes in our Airforce Blue colour.
